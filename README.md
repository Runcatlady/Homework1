# Refactoring for the Horiseon Website

Changes made for more accessibility:

    * 2 arial-labels were added (line 13, 74)
    * 6 alt attributes were added (line 35, 48, 61, 78, 87, 96)

Changes made for more semantic elements:

    * an aside element was added (line 73)

Notes: 

I moved some div elements around. I spaced them out, indented some, and grouped them how I thought would make for a better flow.

I also changed the numbering of a heading tag to h4 in line 107.

I changed the title in line 7 to Horiseon Website.

Lastly, I wanted to wrap the beginning of the body with an aria-label for more accessibility but I am still working on how to do that. Any feedback you have is welcomed.
